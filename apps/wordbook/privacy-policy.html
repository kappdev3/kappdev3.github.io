    <strong>WordBook, Privacy Policy</strong>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the WordBook app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Kappdev (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <strong>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</strong>
    <p>The Application uses Firebase Analytics, a service provided by Google, to collect anonymous or pseudonymized data about your in-app activity. This data helps us understand how users interact with the app and improve the overall user experience.</p>
    <p>The information collected through Firebase Analytics may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Screen views</li>
      <li>Button clicks</li>
      <li>Time spent on certain screens</li>
      <li>App crashes</li>
	  </ul>
    <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or location through Firebase Analytics.</p>

    <strong>How is this information used?</strong>
    <p>The data collected through Firebase Analytics is used for the following purposes:</p>
	  <ul>
      <li>To improve the functionality and usability of the Application</li>
      <li>To personalize the user experience</li>
      <li>To identify and fix bugs and crashes</li>
      <li>To analyze user behavior and trends</li>
	  </ul>

    <strong>Your Choices</strong>
    <p>You can learn more about how Google uses data in its products and services <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" style="color: #007bff; text-decoration: underline;">here</a>.</p>
    <p>While we cannot disable Firebase Analytics within the app itself, you can always uninstall the Application if you do not wish for your anonymized usage data to be collected.</p>

    <strong>Children</strong>
    <p>The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>
    <p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (<a href="mailto:kappdev3@gmail.com" style="color: #007bff; text-decoration: underline;">kappdev3@gmail.com</a>) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>

    <strong>Security</strong>
    <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the anonymized data collected through Firebase Analytics from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>

    <strong>Changes</strong>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
    <p>This privacy policy is effective as of <b>2024-05-09</b>.</p>

    <strong>Your Consent</strong>
    <p>By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your anonymized data collected through Firebase Analytics as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the Service Provider.</p>
